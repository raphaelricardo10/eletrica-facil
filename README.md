The user input the room type and size and the app outputs how many power plugs you need for that room and if the user needs to install power plugs in specific locations.

Additionally, the user can calculate the power and energy cost of a electrical product just inserting its working voltage and current. In this version, the energy cost per KWh is R$ 0,68 and the user cannot change it.
